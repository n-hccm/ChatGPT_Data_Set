The repository storing the files for the initial research covered in my final year project. This repository will be privated sometime in May and will be replaced with the final research project repository instead. 

# Overview
This repo contains the basic files generated during the first phase of my reearch project. Each file contains the prompt that was used to develop it (unless it is a complex project, in which it was instead included as a .txt instead) and stores the vulnerabilities and general notes at the bottom of the file in comments. 

## Why am I researching this?

This project aims to answer the question "Can ChatGPT Program Securely?" for many reasons, but is mainly motivated by the great uptick of GenAI-assisted coding and the recent field of vibe coding. In my upcoming full report, I will be disucssing these motvations, the results of my findings, conclusions and more at length.
